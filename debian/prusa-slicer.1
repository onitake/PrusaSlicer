enabling this feature, as some resins may produce an extreme suction effect
inside the cavity, which makes peeling the print off the vat foil difficult.
(mm, default: 0)
.TP
\fB\-\-pad\-wall\-slope\fR N
The slope of the pad wall relative to the bed plane. 90 degrees means straight

.SH FFF OPTIONS
.SS "Misc options:"
.TP
\fB\-\-avoid\-crossing\-perimeters\fR
Optimize travel moves in order to minimize the crossing of perimeters. This is
mostly useful with Bowden extruders which suffer from oozing. This feature slows
down both the print and the G\-code generation.
.HP
\fB\-\-bed\-custom\-model\fR ABCD
.HP
\fB\-\-bed\-custom\-texture\fR ABCD
.TP
\fB\-\-bed\-shape\fR
(default: 0x0,200x0,200x200,0x200)
.TP
\fB\-\-bed\-temperature\fR N Bed temperature for layers after the first one. Set this to zero to disable bed
temperature control commands in the output. (default: 0)
.TP
\fB\-\-before\-layer\-gcode\fR ABCD
This custom code is inserted at every layer change, right before the Z move.
Note that you can use placeholder variables for all Slic3r settings as well as
[layer_num] and [layer_z].
.TP
\fB\-\-between\-objects\-gcode\fR ABCD
This code is inserted between objects when using sequential printing. By default
extruder and bed temperature are reset using non\-wait command; however if M104,
M109, M140 or M190 are detected in this custom code, Slic3r will not add
temperature commands. Note that you can use placeholder variables for all Slic3r
settings, so you can put a "M109 S[first_layer_temperature]" command wherever
you want.
.TP
\fB\-\-bridge\-acceleration\fR N
This is the acceleration your printer will use for bridges. Set zero to disable
acceleration control for bridges. (mm/s??, default: 0)
.TP

\fB\-\-colorprint\-heights\fR N
Heights at which a filament change is to occur. (default: )
.TP
\fB\-\-complete\-objects\fR
When printing multiple objects or copies, this feature will complete each object
before moving onto next one (and starting it from its bottom layer). This
feature is useful to avoid the risk of ruined prints. Slic3r should warn and
prevent you from extruder collisions, but beware.
.TP
\fB\-\-cooling\fR
This flag enables the automatic cooling logic that adjusts print speed and fan
speed according to layer printing time. (default: 1)
.TP
\fB\-\-cooling\-tube\-length\fR N

acceleration values are used (perimeter/infill). Set zero to prevent resetting
acceleration at all. (mm/s??, default: 0)
.TP
\fB\-\-deretract\-speed\fR N The speed for loading of a filament into extruder after retraction (it only
applies to the extruder motor). If left to zero, the retraction speed is used.
(mm/s, default: 0)

You can set this to a positive value to disable fan at all during the first
layers, so that it does not make adhesion worse. (layers, default: 3)
.TP
\fB\-\-duplicate\-distance\fR N
Distance used for the auto\-arrange feature of the plater. (mm, default: 6)
.TP
\fB\-\-end\-filament\-gcode\fR ABCD

end gcode (and before any toolchange from this filament in case of multimaterial
printers). Note that you can use placeholder variables for all PrusaSlicer
settings. If you have multiple extruders, the gcode is processed in extruder
order. (default: "; Filament\-specific end gcode \en;END gcode for filament\en")
.TP
\fB\-\-end\-gcode\fR ABCD
This end procedure is inserted at the end of the output file. Note that you can
use placeholder variables for all PrusaSlicer settings. (default: M104 S0 ; turn
off temperature\enG28 X0 ; home X axis\enM84 ; disable motors\en)
.TP
\fB\-\-extra\-loading\-move\fR N

unloading. (mm, default: \fB\-2\fR)
.TP
\fB\-\-extruder\-clearance\-height\fR N
Set this to the vertical distance between your nozzle tip and (usually) the X
carriage rods. In other words, this is the height of the clearance cylinder
around your extruder, and it represents the maximum depth the extruder can peek
before colliding with other printed objects. (mm, default: 20)
.TP
\fB\-\-extruder\-clearance\-radius\fR N
Set this to the clearance radius around your extruder. If the extruder is not
centered, choose the largest value for safety. This setting is used to check for
collisions and to display the graphical preview in the plater. (mm, default: 20)
.TP
\fB\-\-extruder\-colour\fR ABCD
This is only used in the Slic3r interface as a visual help. (default: "")
.TP
\fB\-\-extruder\-offset\fR
If your firmware doesn't handle the extruder displacement you need the G\-code to
take it into account. This option lets you specify the displacement of each
extruder with respect to the first one. It expects positive coordinates (they
will be subtracted from the XY coordinate). (mm, default: 0x0)
.TP
\fB\-\-extrusion\-axis\fR ABCD
Use this option to set the axis letter associated to your printer's extruder
(usually E but some printers use A). (default: E)
.TP
\fB\-\-extrusion\-multiplier\fR N
This factor changes the amount of flow proportionally. You may need to tweak
this setting to get nice surface finish and correct single wall widths. Usual
values are between 0.9 and 1.1. If you think you need to change this more, check
filament diameter and your firmware E steps. (default: 1)
.TP
\fB\-\-fan\-always\-on\fR
If this is enabled, fan will never be disabled and will be kept running at least
at its minimum speed. Useful for PLA, harmful for ABS. (default: 0)
.TP
\fB\-\-fan\-below\-layer\-time\fR N
If layer print time is estimated below this number of seconds, fan will be
enabled and its speed will be calculated by interpolating the minimum and
maximum speeds. (approximate seconds, default: 60)
.TP

Enter your filament cost per kg here. This is only for statistical information.
(money/kg, default: 0)
.TP
\fB\-\-filament\-density\fR N
Enter your filament density here. This is only for statistical information. A
decent way is to weigh a known length of filament and compute the ratio of the
length to volume. Better is to calculate the volume directly through
displacement. (g/cm??, default: 0)
.TP
\fB\-\-filament\-deretract\-speed\fR N
The speed for loading of a filament into extruder after retraction (it only
applies to the extruder motor). If left to zero, the retraction speed is used.
(mm/s, default: 0)
.TP

and do multiple measurements along the filament, then compute the average. (mm,
default: 1.75)
.TP
\fB\-\-filament\-load\-time\fR N

Maximum volumetric speed allowed for this filament. Limits the maximum
volumetric speed of a print to the minimum of print and filament volumetric
speed. Set to zero for no limit. (mm??/s, default: 0)
.TP
\fB\-\-filament\-minimal\-purge\-on\-wipe\-tower\fR N
After a tool change, the exact position of the newly loaded filament inside the
nozzle may not be known, and the filament pressure is likely not yet stable.
Before purging the print head into an infill or a sacrificial object, Slic3r
will always prime this amount of material into the wipe tower to produce
successive infill or sacrificial object extrusions reliably. (mm??, default: 15)
.TP
\fB\-\-filament\-notes\fR ABCD
You can put your notes regarding the filament here. (default: "")
.TP
\fB\-\-filament\-ramming\-parameters\fR ABCD

(zero to disable), default: 2)
.TP
\fB\-\-filament\-retract\-lift\fR N
If you set this to a positive value, Z is quickly raised every time a retraction
is triggered. When using multiple extruders, only the setting for the first
extruder will be considered. (mm, default: 0)
.TP

If you set this to a positive value, Z lift will only take place above the
specified absolute Z. You can tune this setting for skipping lift on the first
layers. (mm, default: 0)
.TP

descriptive text. If you print from SD card, the additional weight of the file
could make your firmware slow down.
.TP
\fB\-\-gcode\-flavor\fR
Some G/M\-code commands, including temperature control and others, are not
universal. Set this option to your printer's firmware to get a compatible
output. The "No extrusion" flavor prevents PrusaSlicer from exporting any

9000 usually gives good results if your hardware is up to the job. Set zero to
disable acceleration control for perimeters. (mm/s??, default: 0)
.TP
\fB\-\-post\-process\fR ABCD If you want to process the output G\-code through custom scripts, just list their
absolute paths here. Separate multiple scripts with a semicolon. Scripts will be
passed the absolute path to the G\-code file as the first argument, and they can
access the Slic3r config settings by reading environment variables. (default: )

Emit M73 P[percent printed] R[remaining time in minutes] at 1 minute intervals
into the G\-code to let the firmware show accurate remaining time. As of now only
the Prusa i3 MK3 firmware recognizes M73. Also the i3 MK3 firmware supports M73
Qxx Sxx for the silent mode.
.TP
\fB\-\-resolution\fR N
Minimum detail resolution, used to simplify the input file for speeding up the
slicing job and reducing memory usage. High\-resolution models often carry more
detail than printers can render. Set to zero to disable any simplification and
use full resolution from input. (mm, default: 0)
.TP
\fB\-\-retract\-before\-travel\fR N
Retraction is not triggered when travel moves are shorter than this length. (mm,
default: 2)
.TP
\fB\-\-retract\-before\-wipe\fR

is triggered. When using multiple extruders, only the setting for the first
extruder will be considered. (mm, default: 0)
.TP
\fB\-\-retract\-lift\-above\fR N
If you set this to a positive value, Z lift will only take place above the

layers. (mm, default: 0)
.TP
\fB\-\-retract\-lift\-below\fR N
If you set this to a positive value, Z lift will only take place below the
specified absolute Z. You can tune this setting for limiting lift to the first
layers. (mm, default: 0)
.TP
\fB\-\-retract\-restart\-extra\fR N
When the retraction is compensated after the travel move, the extruder will push
this additional amount of filament. This setting is rarely needed. (mm, default:
0)
.TP
\fB\-\-retract\-restart\-extra\-toolchange\fR N

the number of loops might be greater than the one configured here. Set this to
zero to disable skirt completely. (default: 1)
.TP
\fB\-\-slowdown\-below\-layer\-time\fR N

Number of solid layers to generate on top and bottom surfaces.
.TP
\fB\-\-spiral\-vase\fR
This feature will raise Z gradually while printing a single\-walled object in
order to remove any visible seam. This option requires a single perimeter, no
infill, no top solid layers and no support material. You can still set any
number of bottom solid layers as well as skirt/brim loops. It won't work when
printing more than an object.
.TP
\fB\-\-standby\-temperature\-delta\fR N
Temperature difference to be applied when an extruder is not active. Enables a
full\-height "sacrificial" skirt on which the nozzles are periodically wiped.
(?????C, default: \fB\-5\fR)
.TP
\fB\-\-start\-filament\-gcode\fR ABCD
This start procedure is inserted at the beginning, after any printer start gcode
(and after any toolchange to this filament in case of multi\-material printers).
This is used to override settings for a specific filament. If PrusaSlicer
detects M104, M109, M140 or M190 in your custom codes, such commands will not be
prepended automatically so you're free to customize the order of heating
commands and other custom actions. Note that you can use placeholder variables
for all PrusaSlicer settings, so you can put a "M109 S[first_layer_temperature]"
command wherever you want. If you have multiple extruders, the gcode is
processed in extruder order. (default: "; Filament gcode\en")
.TP
\fB\-\-start\-gcode\fR ABCD
This start procedure is inserted at the beginning, after bed has reached the
target temperature and extruder just started heating, and before extruder has
finished heating. If PrusaSlicer detects M104 or M190 in your custom codes, such
commands will not be prepended automatically so you're free to customize the
order of heating commands and other custom actions. Note that you can use
placeholder variables for all PrusaSlicer settings, so you can put a "M109
S[first_layer_temperature]" command wherever you want. (default: G28 ; home all
axes\enG1 Z5 F5000 ; lift nozzle\en)

.TP
\fB\-\-toolchange\-gcode\fR ABCD
This custom code is inserted before every toolchange. Placeholder variables for
all PrusaSlicer settings as well as {previous_extruder} and {next_extruder} can
be used. When a tool\-changing command which changes to the correct extruder is
included (such as T{next_extruder}), PrusaSlicer will emit no other such
command. It is therefore possible to script custom behaviour both before and
after the toolchange.
.TP
\fB\-\-travel\-speed\fR N
Speed for travel moves (jumps between distant extrusion points). (mm/s, default:
130)
.TP
\fB\-\-use\-firmware\-retraction\fR

the retraction. This is only supported in recent Marlin.
.TP
\fB\-\-use\-relative\-e\-distances\fR
If your firmware requires relative E values, check this, otherwise leave it
unchecked. Most firmwares use absolute values.
.TP
\fB\-\-use\-volumetric\-e\fR
This experimental setting uses outputs the E values in cubic millimeters instead
of linear millimeters. If your firmware doesn't already know filament
diameter(s), you can put commands like 'M200 D[filament_diameter_0] T0' in your
start G\-code in order to turn volumetric mode on and use the filament diameter
associated to the filament selected in Slic3r. This is only supported in recent
Marlin.
.TP

.EE
.TP
\fB\-\-z\-offset\fR N
This value will be added (or subtracted) from all the Z coordinates in the
output G\-code. It is used to compensate for bad Z endstop position: for example,
if your endstop zero actually leaves the nozzle 0.3mm far from the print bed,
set this to \fB\-0\fR.3 (or fix your endstop). (mm, default: 0)

.SH SLA OPTIONS
