Package: slic3r-prusa
Section: oldlibs
Architecture: all
Depends: prusa-slicer, ${misc:Depends}
Description: Transitional package for prusa-slicer
 PrusaSlicer converts digital 3D models into printing instructions (G-code)
 for your 3D printer. It cuts the model into horizontal slices (layers),
 generates toolpaths to fill them and calculates the amount of material
 to be extruded.
 .
 PrusaSlicer supports input in the STL, AMF and OBJ formats, and can output
 G-code for several series of 3D printers, including RepRap, Ultimaker,
 Makerbot, as well as SVG files for DLP printers.
 .
 It can be used with a graphical interface, or in batch mode via the
 command-line.
 .
 This is a transitional package. It can safely be removed.
